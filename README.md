# chatgpt-linux-flatpak
Unofficial ChatGPT app for Linux

An improved fork of faisalkhanshah0's chatgpt-linux Snap package. The original can be found here: https://github.com/faisalkhanshah0/chatgpt-linux.

This version adds the following:
- Translates it into a flatpak (or snap optionally)
- Adds ctrl+w to close
- Allows for file drag and drop
- Prevents multiple instances
- Better support after remapping to a copilot key (requires manual mapping)
- Opens non-sign in links in the defualt browser rather than internally
- Resolves a couple of vulnerabilities
