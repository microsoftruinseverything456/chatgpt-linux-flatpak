# chatgpt-linux-flatpak
Unofficial ChatGPT app for Linux

An improved fork of faisalkhanshah0's chatgpt-linux Snap package. The original can be found here: https://github.com/faisalkhanshah0/chatgpt-linux.

This version translates it into a flatpak (or snap optionally), adds ctrl+w to close, allows for file drag and drop, prevents multiple instances, opens non-sign in links in the defualt browser, and resolves a couple of vulnerabilities.
